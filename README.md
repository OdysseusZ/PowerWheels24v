# PowerWheels Jeep and Lightning McQueen Upgrades
Repository for all code and wiring for the project found in the video above. 
### Please Read Before Proceeding

I am not a professional anything.  This is a modfication I made to my childs vehicle based on my knowledge as a hobbyist and nothing more.  You are wiring batteries together to create more power than the intended use of the vehicle and then putting children in it. Use all the necessary pre-caution, caution and post caution that it deserves.  I take absolutely zero responsibility for anyone elses projects, this is just sharing what I did. I give no gaurantees on anything.  Take that for what it is worth.
